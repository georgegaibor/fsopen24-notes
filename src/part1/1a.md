# Introduction to React

## Create React app with Vite

```shell
npm create vite@latest example -- --template react
```
```shell
cd example
```
```shell
npm run dev
```

## JSX

React components are written in `JSX`. It looks like HTML but it's a  syntax extension of JavaScript. JSX returned by react components is compiled into JS under the hood by `Babel`.

## props
React components use props to communicate (from parent to child components). You can pass any JS value through them.

### `disable ESLint prop validation`

```javascript
'react/prop-types': 0
```
