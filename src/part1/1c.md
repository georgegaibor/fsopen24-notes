# Component state, event handlers


## Direct prop destructuring in React

```js
const Hello = ({ name, age }) => {
  const bornYear = () => new Date().getFullYear() - age

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Hello {name}, you are {age} years old
      </p>
      <p>So you were probably born in {bornYear()}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Stateful component

> Components often need to change what's on screen as a result of an interaction. In React, this kind of component specific memory is called `state`

### useState

```js
import { useState } from 'react'

const App = () => {
  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0)

  setTimeout(
    () => setCounter(counter + 1),
    1000
  )

  return (
    <div>{counter}</div>
  )
}
```

* `useState` react hook used to declare a state variable
* `initialState` parameter for initial state value, it can be of any type

`useState` returns an array with the following state variables:

* `state` current state that matches initial value on first render
* `setState` function that allows for state updates that trigger re-renders

<details><summary><b>REMINDERS</b></summary>

> Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component

> `DO NOT` call Hooks inside loops or conditions

> `setState` functions do not have a return value and only update the state for the next render

</details>

## Event Handling

* Functions that trigger in response to `interactions` like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, etc.

* React lets you add event handlers to the JSX.

## Adding an event handler

```js
export default function Button() {
  function handleClick() { //1. Declare handler function
    alert('You clicked me!'); //2. Define function logic
  }

  return (// 3. Pass function to onClick in the button's JSX
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```
