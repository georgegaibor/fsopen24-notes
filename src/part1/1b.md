# Javascript

## Variables

* `const` declares block-scoped local variables. The value of a constant `can't be changed` through reassignment using the assignment operator, but if a constant is an object, its properties can be added, updated, or removed.

* `let` declares re-assignable, block-scoped local variables, optionally initializing each to a value.

## Arrays

```javascript
const t = [1, -1, 3]

const t2 = t.concat(5)  // creates new array
```

> Contents can be modified even though it is defined as a const, because the array is an object.

### Destructuring assignment

Expression that helps to unpack values from arrays, or object properties into variables.

```javascript
const t = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const [first, second, ...rest] = t

console.log(first, second)  // 1, 2 is printed
console.log(rest)          // [3, 4, 5] is printed
```

## Functional Programming in React

> React incorporates functional programming techniques, one trait of this paradigm is the use of immutable data structures.

> It is preferable to use methods that create new objects when modifiying an existing object, ensuring the original remains unchanged.

## Objects

```javascript
//definition through object literals
const object3 = {
  name: {
    first: 'Dan',
    last: 'Abramov',
  },
  grades: [2, 3, 5, 3],
  department: 'Stanford University',
}
```

> Properties can be of any js type

```javascript
//property reference
console.log(object3.name.first) // dot notation, prints Dan
console.log(object3['grades']) // brackets, prints [2, 3, 5, 3]
```

## Functions
 
Three ways of defining functions:

### Arrow function

```javascript
const sum = (p1, p2) => {
  console.log(p1)
  console.log(p2)
  return p1 + p2
}
```

### Function declaration

```javascript
function product(a, b) {
  return a * b
}
```

### Function expression

```javascript
const average = function(a, b) {
  return (a + b) / 2
}
```
